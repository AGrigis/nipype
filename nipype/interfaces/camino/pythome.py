	-inputmodel <model>
		One of the following:
		dt - diffusion tensor data, as produced by dtfit.
		multitensor - diffusion tensor data, as produced by multitenfit. 
			  Presently, track supports a maximum of two tensors per voxel for PICo.
			  Three tensors per voxel is allowed for streamline tracking.
			  The maximum number of tensor components in a voxel is controlled by the maxcomponents option, and the default is 2.
		pds - principal directions, as produced by sfpeaks. 
			  The maximum number of PDs in a voxel (if different from the default of 3) is specified by the numpds option.
		pico - PICo PDFs, as produced by picopdfs.
		bootstrap - raw data to be bootstrapped.
		ballstick - as produced by ballstickfit.
		bayesdirac - raw data for Bayesian tracking.

	-inputdatatype <type>
		If any bootstrapping options are specified, the default input data type is "float". Otherwise, it is "double".

	-numpds <number>
		The maximum number of PDs in a voxel for input models pds and pico. 
		The default is 3 for input model pds and 1 for input model pico.
		This option determines the size of the voxels in the input file and does not affect tracking.
		For tensor data, this option is not used. If the input model is "dt", the number of PDs in each voxel is 1.
		If the input model is "multitensor", the number of PDs is specified by the -maxcomponents option.

	-maxcomponents <number>
		The maximum number of tensor components in a voxel.
		This determines the size of the input file and does not say anything about the voxel classification.
		The default is 2 if the input model is multitensor and 1 if the input model is dt.

	-datadims <x> <y> <z>
		The x, y, and z dimension of the data, in voxels.
		Not required if a seed file is used, unless the seed dimensions do not agree with the diffusion dimensions.
		In either case, the physical coordinates of seed space MUST be aligned to diffusion space,
		i.e. a point in mm must be the same location in both, even if the voxel coordinates are different.

	-voxeldims <x> <y> <z>
		The x, y, and z dimension of each voxel, in millimetres.
		Not required if a seed file is used, unless the seed dimensions do not agree with the diffusion dimensions.
		In either case, the physical coordinates of seed space MUST be aligned to diffusion space, 
		i.e. a point in mm must be the same location in both, even if the voxel coordinates are different. 
		
		
		
	**************	OUTPUT OPTIONS   **************

	-gzip
		Compress output using the gzip algorithm.

	-outputtracts <format>
		Output streamlines, in one of the following formats: raw binary, voxels, oogl, or ooglbinary. The default is to output raw tracts.
		The raw streamline format is 32 bit float. For each streamline, the program outputs the number of points N in the streamline, 
		the index of the seed point, followed by the (x,y,z) coordinates (in mm) of each point: 
		[<N>, <seed point index>, <x_1>, <y_1>, <z_1>,...,<x_numPoints>, <y_N>, <z_N>, <N>,...,<z_N>], 
		where the <seed point index> is the point on the streamline where tracking began.

		The voxels format is 16-bit signed integer, and lists the integer indices of all M voxels that the streamline passes through, 
		in the format [<M>, <seed point index>, <vx_1>, <vy_1>, <vz_1>,...,<vx_M>, <vy_M>, <vz_M>, M,...,<vz_M>].
		The voxels are defined in the seed space.

		The OOGL format option, oogl, outputs a LIST of OOGL VECT objects in ASCII format. 
		The colour at each point on the streamline is an RGB vector that describes the local orientation as a combination of red (x), green (y) and blue (z). 
		The ooglbinary option outputs the same objects in the OOGL binary format.

	-outputroot <string>
		Prepended onto all output file names. Used to segregate output by ROI. 
		If this is not specified, all output goes to the file specified with the -outputfile option. 
		If no output file is specified, the output goes to stdout.

	-outputfile <string>
		Name of the file to which all output should be written. This option is ignored if -outputroot is set.

	 * This program does post-processing of streamline output from track. It can either output streamlines or connection probability maps. 
	 * http://web4.cs.ucl.ac.uk/research/medic/camino/pmwiki/pmwiki.php?n=Man.procstreamlines
	 
	 OPTIONS

	The following list details the options pertaining to the input data, the tractography parameters, the output, and the PICo parameters.

	DATA OPTIONS

	-inputmodel <model>
		One of the following:


		  raw - raw streamline data (default).
		  voxels - voxel lists.

	-datadims <x> <y> <z>
		The x, y, and z dimension of the data, in voxels. Not required if a seed, exclusion, waypoint or target file is given.

	-voxeldims <x> <y> <z>
		The x, y, and z dimension of each voxel, in millimetres. Not required if a seed, exclusion, waypoint or target file is given.

	-mintractpoints <minpoints>

		Streamlines that consist of fewer than minpoints will be discarded.

	-mintractlength <minlength>

		Streamlines are discarded if their length is less than minlength mm.

	-maxtractpoints <maxpoints>

		Streamlines that consist of more than maxpoints will be truncated to maxpoint in length. Specifying this option will automatically disable resampling of tracts.

	-maxtractlength <maxlength>

		Streamlines longer than maxlength mm will be truncated. This calculation is done before resampling, so the truncation is accurate to the original resolution of the tract.

	 
	SEED OPTIONS

	-seedpointmm <x> <y> <z>
		The coordinates of a single seed point for tractography, in mm.

	-seedpointvox <x> <y> <z>
		The voxel coordinates of a single seed point for tractography. Tracking will proceed from the centre of voxel (x,,y,x,z). This option overrides -seedpointmm. The voxel indices are numbered from 0 to (data dimension) - 1.

	-seedfile <file.[hdr | nii | mha | mhd]>
		Image containing seed points. If an output root is specified, the output is grouped according to the intensity of the seed in this image. This option overrides -seedpointvox and -seedpointmm.

	-regionindex <index>
		Process the specified region in the seed file.

	 
	OTHER OPTIONS

	-iterations
		Number of streamlines generated for each seed. Not required when outputting streamlines, but needed to create PICo images. The default is 1 if the output is streamlines, and 5000 if the output is connection probability images.

	-targetfile <file>
		Image containing target volumes. Targets are defined as regions of the image with the same intensity. If this option is given, the PICo maps will only localise connection probability to the volumes bounded by the targets. The connection probability to a target from a seed is the fraction of streamlines that pass anywhere within the target volume.

	-allowmultitargets
		Allows streamlines to connect to multiple target volumes. By default, the program only counts the first entry to a target volume.

	-directional <X> <Y> <Z>
		Splits the streamlines at the seed point and computes separate connection probabilities for each segment. Streamline segments are grouped according to their dot product with the vector (X, Y, Z). The ideal vector will be tangential to the streamline trajectory at the seed, such that the streamline projects from the seed along (X, Y, Z) and -(X, Y, Z). However, it is only necessary for the streamline trajectory to not be orthogonal to (X, Y, Z).

	-waypointfile <file.[hdr | nii | mha | mhd]>
		Image containing waypoints. Waypoints are defined as regions of the image with the same intensity, where 0 is background and any value > 0 is a waypoint. Streamlines are discarded if they do not pass through at least one voxel of each waypoint volume.

	-truncateloops
		This option allows streamlines to enter a waypoint exactly once. After the streamline leaves the waypoint, it is truncated upon a second entry to the waypoint. For the purposes of this operation, the streamline is divided into two segments at the seed point. Each segment is allowed to enter each waypoint once and the segment is truncated at a second entry.

	-discardloops
		This option allows streamlines to enter a waypoint exactly once. After the streamline leaves the waypoint, the entire streamline is discarded upon a second entry to the waypoint. For the purposes of this operation, the streamline is divided into two segments at the seed point. Each segment is allowed to enter each waypoint once and the entire streamline is discarded if either segment enters a waypoint twice.

	-exclusionfile <file.[hdr | nii | mha | mhd]>
		Image containing exclusion ROIs. This should be an Analyze 7.5 header / image file.hdr and file.img. By default, exclusion ROIs are treated as anti-waypoints - streamlines that enter any exclusion ROI are discarded. if the -truncateinexclusion option is given, streamlines are truncated upon entry to an exclusion ROI, but not discarded.

	-truncateinexclusion
		Retain segments of a streamline before entry to an exclusion ROI. If this is not specified, streamlines that enter an exclusion ROI are discarded.

	-endpointfile <file.[hdr | nii | mha | mhd]>
		Image containing endpoint ROIs. This should be an Analyze 7.5 header / image file.hdr and file.img. Endpoint ROIs are defined as regions of the image with the same intensity, where 0 is background and any value > 0 is an endpoint ROI. Streamlines are discarded if they do not connect two different endpoint ROIs.

	-resamplestepsize <size>
		Each point on a streamline is tested for entry into target, exclusion or waypoint volumes. If the length between points on a tract is not much smaller than the voxel length, then streamlines may pass through part of a voxel without being counted. To avoid this, the program resamples streamlines such that the step size is one tenth of the smallest voxel dimension in the image. This increases the size of raw or oogl streamline output and incurs some performance penalty. The resample resolution can be controlled with this option or disabled altogether by passing a negative step size or by passing the -noresample option.

	-noresample
		Disables resampling of input streamlines. Resampling is automatically disabled if the input model is voxels.

	 
	OUTPUT OPTIONS

	-gzip
		Compress output using the gzip algorithm.

	-outputtracts <format>

		Output streamlines, in one of the following formats: raw binary, voxels, or oogl. If neither -outputtracts nor -outputcp is specified, the default is to output raw tracts.

	-outputcp
		Output the connection probability map for each seed. The map is an Analyze image with data type float. If targets are specified, then the image values in each target voxel are the fraction of streamlines that connect to that target. Without targets, the image is the fraction of streamlines that connect to each voxel.

	-outputsc
		Output the connection probability map for each seed. The output is the same as with -outputcp except that the values are not normalized, so the image contains the raw streamline counts. The map is an Analyze image with data type int.

	-outputacm
		Combine all tracts in the input into a single connection probability map. Outputs a single Analyze image where each voxel contains the number of streamlines that enter the voxel. If -outputcp is also specified, the values are divided by the total number of streamlines in the input.

	-outputcbs
		Perform connectivity based segmentation. This option produces outputs. The first is
		 an image where each seed point in the ROI is labelled with the value of the target  to which the seed is most likely to connect. The second is an image where each seed point is labelled with the streamline count (default) or connection probability (if -outputcp is also specified) to the labelled target. A target file is required for this option.

	-outputroot <string>
		Prepended onto all output file names. If the output is streamlines, then using this option tells the program to separate streamlines by ROI. See track(1).
